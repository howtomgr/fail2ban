  "description": "Fail2ban is a free and open-source intrusion prevention software framework that protects servers from brute-force attacks. Written in Python, it monitors log files and bans IP addresses that show malicious signs such as too many password failures or seeking exploits. It serves as a powerful FOSS alternative to commercial security solutions like Cloudflare Rate Limiting, AWS WAF, or proprietary IPS systems, providing enterprise-grade protection without licensing costs or vendor lock-in.",
